# Find the element in a singly linked list that's m elements
# from the end. For example, if a linked list has 5 elements,
# the 3rd element from the end is the 3rd element.
# The function definition should look like question5(ll, m),
# where ll is the first node of a linked list and m is the
# "mth number from the end". You should copy/paste the Node
# class below to use as a representation of a node in the
# linked list. Return the value of the node at that position.

# An Element has some value associated with it (which could
# be anythingâ€”a number, a string, a character, et cetera),
# and it has a variable that points to the next element
# in the linked list.

        # the end of the list.
